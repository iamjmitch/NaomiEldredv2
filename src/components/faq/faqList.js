However, Naomi will always work with you to create a look you love and will never let you leave until you are more than 100% happy.",

    question: "Do I need to prep before the appointment?",
    answer:
      "Naomi loves it if you come along with no makeup on. Exfoliating and moisturising prior to the appointment really helps, as does fresh groomed eyebrows too! It all helps in the flawless makeup application.",

    question: "Will I need to touch up my makeup?",
    answer:
      "Your foundation and eye makeup will be applied to ensure maximum wear, so it will last for hours without a touch up. However, if your skin is prone to oiliness, Naomi does recommend a powder compact or blotting papers. You will need to touch up your lipstick. Naomi can supply a small sample of lipstick for touch ups. Alternatively, on the day of a trial Naomi can make a small list of products for you to purchase.",
